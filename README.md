# Fiber Optic Weigh In Motion Sensor
  This project is done to develop optical fiber sensor to measure weigh of moving vehicle. The sensor consist of optical fiber embedded inside rubber structure. The light properties inside the fiber will change indicating the characteristic of the vehichle that pass through the sensor.

1. Install required modules with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the program with `python mandelbrot_generator.py`
3. Wait for the program to compute
4. Check the notebook file
